		<p>Raise your hand if you don't love a guy in a good suit. If you just did then I'm sorry you're in the wrong place. Right now we want to appreciate guys who put a little effort into their clothes because Lord knows not every man has such efforts.
		If you're a big fan of the Gram or any other social media platform then you might recognise these names: Toni Mahfud, Mariano Di Vaio, Andrea Denver,JOn KOrtajarena and NIck Bateman.
	This are some of the guys who in  my opinion look fine as hell already and when they wear a suit........ </p>

				<h3>Nick Bateman in a red checkered suit</h3>
				<p>He's an actor, model, fitness  guru and most importantly a father and husband. He's style is mostly suave and business like but he knows how to lay back when he needs to.

				<h3>Toni Mahfud </h3>
				<p>. He is a model and most of all an artist. He's vibe is often elemental and you csn tell he puuts his heart and soul into everything he does. He has modelled for a lot of brands but according to me he is in his element in JOOP clothes.

				<h3>Nick Bateman In Black </h3>
				<p>I kknow i've already mentioned him but come on! You can never have too much of Bateman. He is a man of many talents and we should appreciate them all. And what better way than to recognise how good he looks in that suit?
